# Development Progress: NSRL-to-UCO Converter

## Completed Features
- Basic file conversion functionality
- UCO property mapping
- Hash value formatting with proper types
- Namespace corrections
- UTC timestamp implementation
- CASE validation integration
- Combined graph output
- Documentation updates

## Active Development
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Memory usage improvements
- Documentation refinement
- Additional validation features

## Current Sprint Tasks
1. Performance
   - [x] Implement streaming JSON parsing
   - [x] Add memory usage monitoring
   - [ ] Further optimize large file handling

2. Validation
   - [x] Add UCO schema validation
   - [x] Implement relationship validation
   - [x] Add output format verification
   - [x] Integrate CASE Utilities
   

3. Testing
   - [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
   - [ ] Add performance benchmarks
   - [ ] Test large dataset handling
   - [ ] Add validation test cases

## Known Issues
1. Performance with very large NSRL files (so far they are small)
2. Memory optimization opportunities
3. Additional validation rules needed

## Next Milestone
1. Performance Improvements
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Improve processing speed
   - Enhance batch processing

2. Testing Framework
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests (if needed)
   - Validation tests
   - Performance benchmarks

3. Documentation
   - Update as needed
